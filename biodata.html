                    Hello! I'm Hizkia Julio, I am from Klaten, Central Java. I was born on July 24, 2005. I studied from elementary to junior high school in the Klaten area of central Java, then I continued high school at Purwodadi Adventist Advanced School, commonly known as (SLAPUR). When I was in high school, I studied online for approximately 1 year and started attending SLAPUR in grade 11.<br>
                    In grade 11, I was elected as a member of the student council as the chairman of the state defense, even though I was elected while still online. When I came to SLAPUR, I had to temporarily separate from my parents for the first time; there I had to start living independently, as in SLAPUR, you have to get up by yourself unlike when you are at home, and if you clean your clothes, you have to do it alone.<br>
                    While at SLAPUR, I also had the opportunity to be a teacher in the dormitory until grade 12 semester 1. This is where I could help my parents ease the cost of schooling at SLAPUR. Although the income was not too much, it was enough to help with my school fees during high school.<br>
                    After graduating from high school, I continued my studies at the Indonesian Adventist University (UNAI). Although this was suggested by my parents, I complied because the study fee was paid by them. I have an ambition to create an application that can be useful for others.

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    As a junior studying web development, I've found this journey both exciting and challenging. One of the aspects I love most is the creativity involved in designing websites. Being able to transform an idea into a visually appealing and functional platform feels incredibly rewarding. I enjoy learning new frameworks and languages, and seeing how they can enhance user experience keeps me motivated.<br>
                    However, there are definitely some challenges. Debugging can be particularly frustrating—there are moments when I feel like I'm staring at my screen for hours without finding a solution. Additionally, the fast-paced nature of the tech industry can be overwhelming. Keeping up with the latest trends and tools feels like a constant race, and sometimes I worry about falling behind.<br>
                    Overall, despite the hurdles, my passion for creating and problem-solving drives me to keep pushing forward. I know that every challenge I face is an opportunity to grow as a developer!
