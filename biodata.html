                    <h2>My personal Info</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hello! I'm Hizkia Julio,I From Klaten,Central Java. I was born on July 24, 2005. I studied from elementary to junior high school in the Klaten area of central Java, then I continued high school at Purwodadi Adventist Advanced School or commonly known as (SLAPUR), when I was in high school I had studied online or commonly called online for approximately 1 year and I started going to Slapur in grade 11.<br>  
                        In grade 11, I was elected as a member of the student council as the chairman of the state defense even though I was elected when I was still online. when I came to Slapur, I had to temporarily separate from my parents for the first time there I had to start living independently, because in Slapur you have to get up by yourself unlike when you are at home and if you clean your clothes, you have to be alone.<br>
                        When I was in Slapur, I also had time to be a teacher in the dormitory until grade 12 semester 1, this is where I can help my parents to ease the cost of school in Slapur although the income is not too much but it is enough to help ease my school fees during high school. <br>
                        After graduating from high school I continued my studies at the Indonesian Adventist University (UNAI) even though this was told by my parents, but I had to comply because the study fee was paid by my parents, and I have an ambition to create an application that can be useful for other people.

                    <h2>My testimony on web Develompent</h2>
                    <p>
                        As a junior studying web development, I've found this journey both exciting and challenging. One of the aspects I love most is the creativity involved in designing websites. Being able to transform an idea into a visually appealing and functional platform feels incredibly rewarding. I enjoy learning new frameworks and languages, and seeing how they can enhance user experience keeps me motivated.
                        <br>
                        However, there are definitely some challenges. Debugging can be particularly frustrating—there are moments when I feel like I'm staring at my screen for hours without finding a solution. Additionally, the fast-paced nature of the tech industry can be overwhelming. Keeping up with the latest trends and tools feels like a constant race, and sometimes I worry about falling behind.
                        <br>
                        Overall, despite the hurdles, my passion for creating and problem-solving drives me to keep pushing forward. I know that every challenge I face is an opportunity to grow as a developer!
